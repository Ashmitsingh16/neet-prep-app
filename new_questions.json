    "explanation": "In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: p² + 2pq + q² = 1. If q² (aa) = 0.16, then q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, p = 0.6. Frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) = 2pq = 2 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.48.",

      "D": "Implantation of blastocyst"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The proliferative (follicular) phase (days 5-14 approximately) is marked by regeneration and thickening of the endometrium under the influence of increasing estrogen secreted by the developing Graafian follicle. This prepares the uterus for possible implantation.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Microsporogenesis occurs in the pollen sacs of anthers. The diploid microspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid microspores (tetrad). Each microspore develops into a pollen grain (male gametophyte) through mitotic division to form a 2-celled (vegetative + generative) or 3-celled structure.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The first approved gene therapy (1990) treated ADA deficiency (a type of SCID - severe combined immunodeficiency). Lymphocytes from the patient were cultured, a functional ADA gene was introduced using a retroviral vector, and the engineered cells were returned to the patient. This corrected the immune deficiency.",
