      { id: "so45", year: 2022, question: "Dicot stem has:", options: ["Vascular bundles in a ring with pith in centre", "Scattered vascular bundles", "No vascular bundles", "Only one vascular bundle"], correct: 0, explanation: "Dicot stem: epidermis → cortex → endodermis → pericycle → vascular bundles (conjoint, collateral, open, in a ring) → pith. Monocot: scattered bundles, no pith distinction." },
      { id: "so46", year: 2021, question: "Passage cells in endodermis are:", options: ["Thin-walled cells opposite protoxylem that allow water passage", "Thick-walled cells", "Dead cells", "Companion cells"], correct: 0, explanation: "Passage cells: thin-walled endodermal cells (lack Casparian thickening) opposite protoxylem points. Allow water and solute movement into vascular cylinder." },
      { id: "so47", year: 2020, question: "Glandular epithelium is specialised for:", options: ["Secretion of substances (hormones, enzymes, mucus)", "Absorption", "Protection", "Contraction"], correct: 0, explanation: "Glandular epithelium: columnar/cuboidal cells modified for secretion. Exocrine glands (ducts: sweat, salivary) and endocrine glands (ductless: thyroid, pituitary)." },
      { id: "so48", year: 2019, question: "Cambium is a:", options: ["Lateral meristem responsible for secondary growth", "Apical meristem", "Ground tissue", "Permanent tissue"], correct: 0, explanation: "Vascular cambium: between xylem and phloem. Produces secondary xylem (wood, inward) and secondary phloem (bark, outward). Increases plant girth." },
      { id: "so49", year: 2025, question: "Stratified squamous epithelium is found in:", options: ["Skin, mouth, and esophagus (protection from abrasion)", "Kidney tubules", "Trachea", "Blood vessels"], correct: 0, explanation: "Stratified squamous: multiple layers with flat surface cells. Provides protection. Keratinised (skin) or non-keratinised (mouth, oesophagus, vagina)." },
      { id: "so50", year: 2024, question: "Heartwood differs from sapwood in that:", options: ["Heartwood is dark, non-functional in conduction, filled with resins/tannins", "Heartwood conducts water", "Sapwood is darker", "Heartwood is outer wood"], correct: 0, explanation: "Heartwood: central, dark (deposited tannins, resins, oils), non-conducting, durable. Sapwood: peripheral, lighter, functional in conduction, less durable." },
