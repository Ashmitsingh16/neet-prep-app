      { id: "tx4", year: 2024, question: "Lichens are symbiotic associations between:", options: ["Algae/cyanobacteria and fungi", "Bacteria and fungi", "Two different fungi", "Algae and bacteria"], correct: 0, explanation: "Lichens: mutualistic association where algae/cyanobacteria (photobiont) provide food, and fungi (mycobiont) provide protection and absorb water/minerals." },
      { id: "tx5", year: 2023, question: "The binomial nomenclature system was given by:", options: ["Carolus Linnaeus", "Charles Darwin", "Robert Hooke", "Gregor Mendel"], correct: 0, explanation: "Linnaeus introduced binomial nomenclature (two-name system: Genus species) in Species Plantarum (1753). He's the 'Father of Taxonomy'." },
      { id: "tx6", year: 2023, question: "Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) belong to:", options: ["Kingdom Monera", "Kingdom Protista", "Kingdom Plantae", "Kingdom Fungi"], correct: 0, explanation: "Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes (no true nucleus) and belong to Monera despite being photosynthetic. They're not true algae (which are eukaryotic Protista)." },
